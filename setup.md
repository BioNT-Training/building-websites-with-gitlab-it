title: Setup
---

**Required**

Prior to the workshop you will need to setup a free account for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
or (*preferentially*) on the local EMBL instance [git.embl.de](https://git.embl.de/).
If you need assistance with loggin in the EMBL GitLab platform,
check [these instructions](https://grp-bio-it.embl-community.io/blog/posts/2021-01-29-mattermost-embl-chat/#login-via-gitlab).

**Optional**

During the course we will teach how to use GitLab in the online platform, but not how to use
Git locally on your laptop. Still, knowing Git might be useful to take your web dev skills
next level. So, please consider installing the Bash Shell and Git in your laptop, following
[these instructions][workshop-setup] from The Carpentries.

Once you have Git and the Bash Shell installed, you are all set to follow
[these training materials](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and learn the basis of Git.
